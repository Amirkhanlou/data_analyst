Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.\n",

This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "**_The P-value of the `ab_page` of multiple linear regression with only linear term used in section III.1(g) remained the same as what we found from the single linear regression III.1(d). This means that the addition of the countries to the inputs did not influence the impact of `ab_page` on the conversion rate. However, the Pseudo R-squ. did improved with the addition of the countries, suggesting the second fit would produce more accurate predictions in general_**\n",
    "\n",
    "**_The P-values of the added countries are high which again shows they are not significant in the predictions_**\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Looking at the coefficients, we can conclude that the conversion were likely to happen 1.1 more times for UK users and 1.04 times less in Canada when compared to the US users when all other parameters are held constant.\n",
    "The coefficients also reveal for every user who views the new web page, the chance of conversion is reduced by 1.01 times_**\n",
    "\n",
    "**_When we add the interaction terms in section III.1(h), first we notice that R-squ. continued to improve by ~50% compared to the last fit in III.1(g) which is promising. The P-values of this latest fit suggest that non of the terms used for this fit has a major significance to influence this model. The P-values are all high. The `ab_page` coefficient is changed comparing to the model without interaction terms which is expected since we have added two more interaction terms that brings in `ab_page` into the calculations so addition of those two term would influence the term excluded only to `ab_page`. Overall, the last model adds more complexity into the interpretation of the coefficients. This model tells us that if we are interested in knowing the influence of these variables, non of the input variables shows a very strong impact into the predictions we could consider not using this model for practicality reasons, however if the precision of the prediction is the goal of this exercise, the improved Pseudo R-squ. of the last model, suggests this may be worth consideration_**\n",

    "Once you are satisfied with the status of your Notebook, you should save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you are working locally and get an error about \"No module name\", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the \"<\" or \">\" or any words following a period in the module name).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit both your original Notebook and an HTML or PDF copy of the Notebook for review. There is no need for you to include any data files with your submission. If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a \"Resources\" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a `readme.txt` file documenting your sources.\n",

    "When you're ready, click on the \"Submit Project\" button to go to the project submission page. You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.\n",

    "It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by beginning the next module in the program."
